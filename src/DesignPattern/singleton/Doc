 Def: For any java class if  we  allow to create only one object/instance such type of class is called Singleton class
  Example :
   1. Runtime(Java Runtime class is used to interact with java runtime environment. Java Runtime class provides
      methods to execute a process, invoke GC, get total and free memory in JVM etc),
      So By Runtime object we can communicate with JVM
   2. Business Delegate,  service locator etc
      Advanced of Singleton class

what is the need of Singleton object? Advantage class of singleClass
if several people have same requirement then it is not
requirement to create a separate object for every requirement. so for this causes
 - performance and memory utilise is the main reason for Singleton
 - Here run time a sob object akta object ar memory share kore thake

Example :
         Runtime r1 = Runtime.getRuntime();
         Runtime r2 = Runtime.getRuntime();
         Runtime r3 = Runtime.getRuntime();
         Runtime r4 = Runtime.getRuntime();

Way to Create Single class :
We must make the constructor private first .
Approach One (this is guaranteed to be thread safe) : private static className var = new ClassName();
               Under The CLass So that In the Run time It will create a Obj for EveryRequest.
Runtime class is internally implemented using this way of create singleton class.
example : SingleTonByRuntimeCreation
Here we have created instance of singleton in static initializer. JVM executes static initializer
when the class is loaded and hence this is guaranteed to be thread safe. Use this method only when
your singleton class is light and is used throughout the execution of your program.
With synchronized Way :
// Only one thread can execute this at a time
    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance()
    {
        if (obj==null)
            obj = new Singleton();
        return obj;
    }
Here using synchronized makes sure that only one thread at a time can execute getInstance().
The main disadvantage of this is method is that using synchronized every time while creating the
singleton object is expensive and may decrease the performance of your program. However if performance
of getInstance() is not critical for your application this method provides a clean and simple solution
Example : SingleTonByLazyWayWithSynchronized

Approach Two : When the first request comes then It will create the obj and after that other will reuse this obj
              Private static CLassName var =null;
              example : SingleTonByAfterFirstRequest
Do you know what is the main Use of private constructor ?:
> Private constructor main use is to create singleton class.

Approach Three : Double Checked Locking

kono class k final declare korle setar ar child class(oi class k kau extends korte pare na) create kora jai na but
jodi class is not final then kivabe child class child class create kora protect kora jabe ?
ans: Oi mother class ar constructor k private kore dite hobe :)
