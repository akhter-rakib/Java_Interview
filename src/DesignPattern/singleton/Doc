 Def: For any java class if  we  allow to create only one object/instance such type of class is called Singleton class
  Example :
   1. Runtime(Java Runtime class is used to interact with java runtime environment. Java Runtime class provides
      methods to execute a process, invoke GC, get total and free memory in JVM etc),
      So By Runtime object we can communicate with JVM
   2. Business Delegate,  service locator etc
      Advanced of Singleton class

what is the need of Singleton object? Advantage class of singleClass
if several people have same requirement then it is not
requirement to create a separate object for every requirement. so for this causes
 - performance and memory utilise is the main reason for Singleton
 - Here run time a sob object akta object ar memory share kore thake

Example :
         Runtime r1 = Runtime.getRuntime();
         Runtime r2 = Runtime.getRuntime();
         Runtime r3 = Runtime.getRuntime();
         Runtime r4 = Runtime.getRuntime();

Way to Create Single class :
We must make the constructor private first .
Approach One : private static className var = new ClassName();
               Under The CLass So that In the Run time It will create a Obj for EveryRequest.

Approach Two : Private static CLassName var =null;
 When the first request comes then It will create the obj and after that other will reuse this obj
 Runtime class is internally implemented using the first way(Look the exmp : SingleTonCLassWayOne) of create singleton class.

Do you know what is the main Use of private constructor ?:
> Private constructor main use is to create singleton class.

kono class k final declare korle setar ar child class(oi class k kau extends korte pare na) create kora jai na but
jodi class is not final then kivabe child class child class create kora protect kora jabe ?
ans: Oi mother class ar constructor k private kore dite hobe :)
