Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and based on the
requirement from client, we need to return one of the sub-class object. This pattern take out the responsibility of
instantiation of a class from client program to the factory class.
Super class in factory design pattern can be an interface, abstract class or a normal java class.
