What is IOC ?
It's simply the design process of externalizing, the construction and management of your objects.
So, in a nutshell, it basically says that your application's gonna outsource the creation and management of
the objects, and that outsourcing will be handled by an object factory(Spring Container), and that's
the big idea of inversion of control.
