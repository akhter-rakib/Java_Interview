Serialization : The process of converting an object from java supported form to Either File supported form Or
Network supported form is called Serialization
 By using FileOutputStream and ObjectOutputStream classes we can achieve

 We have to Implement the Serializable interface in which class need to be made serialize. OtherWise in the
 compile time we will not get any error but in runtime there will be found a serializable error.
 Code Example : SerializeDemo



De Serialization : The process of converting an object from either file or network supported form into java supported
form is called De Serialization .
 By using fileInput Stream and ObjectInputStream Classes we can achieve.


 Transient access modifier : transient mean not to serialize
 Final and static variable : There will be no effect if we want to use transient in this final and static variable

 Anynumber of Serialization concept and how we De Serialization that : example : NumberOfSerialization and
