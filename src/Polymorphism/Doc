#Polymorphism
 Here Poly   = many
     morphs = forms
 It is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.

# Same name but different argument type is the  concept of overloading .
# If the child is not satisfied with the implementation of parent implementation then if the child
  class goes for reimplementation base on their requirement then the concept it comes overriding . In the overriding concept everything
  is same of the method I mean same name, same argument .

There Are two types of polymorphism
 1. Compile Time / Static type / Early binding
   Example : Overloading .
 2. RunTime / Dynamic Type / Late Binding
   Example : Overriding

# Upcasting : If the reference variable of Parent class refers to the object of Child class, it is known as upcasting.
  For example: A a=new B();// Upcasting

# Why Overriding called Runtime polymorphism :
  P p = new C();
  p.eat();
At compile time compile will check the eat() is available in the parent class. if it is not present
 then compiler will gives a error if it is present then  At run time jvm will check in this child class
 is overriding the method  or not. if it is Overriding then base on run time object child class method
 will be called .the Overriding is also called run time polymorphism .
