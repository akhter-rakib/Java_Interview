Polymorphism
Here Poly   = many
     morphs = forms
It is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.

# Same name but different argument type is the  concept of overloading .
# If the child is not satisfied with the implementation of parent implementation then if the child
class goes for reimplementation then the concept it comes overriding . In the overriding concept everything
is same of the method I mean same name, same argument .

There Are two types of polymorphism
1. Compile Time / Static type / Early binding
   Example : Overloading .
2. RunTime / Dynamic Type / Late Binding
   Example : Overriding
